Her children are in their 40s, have their own children, live in other states, and visit once per year on holidays. Inga has started a home based business selling Mary Kay and needs an easy to maintain website to direct people to from her business cards.</p><p> <span class="strong">Inga is familiar with computers</span> to the extent that she checks her email daily, forwards jokes to her friends, and occasionally hops on Facebook to post comments about what may have gone wrong in her day. Inga is easily frustrated, and has a slow internet connection at home. Any website she uses must be light, and easy to use. She is easily confused by an abundance of information. inga does not use a smartphone, and anytime she has a tech problem, she calls her gardner.</p><p> <span class="strong">Inga is essentially retired</span> and is involved in Mary Kay to essentially fight off Alzheimers.
